Vocab List
==========

This makes a vocabulary list from a plain text book. It does it in the simplest way imaginable: each word goes in the list in order of first occurrence in the text. Soon, it will also exclude words that are in a common block file (for words you already know).

## Why might you care?

If you're pretty far along learning a foreign language, eventually regular lessons aren't what's going to help you most. I'm at that point with Duolingo in French (although I still do that consistently anyway). You need to expose yourself to fluent usage of the language, whether written or spoken, a conversation or just consuming. This script is for people who've chosen to consume texts, clearly. It's good because you can batch your dictionary lookups and study before you read the next few pages, so that you can just focus on the reading, rather than ever having to stop to look up a word.

Also, you might care if you're looking for the ultra hard mode of language learning. If you haven't studied a language at all, you could, in theory, use this script to do so fairly well. I don't really recommend that, but it is an idea that's intrigued me for a while. Let me know if you try it, and it works for you.
